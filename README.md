> **Note**: TikTok tabs will open in the background. You may need to manually add captions, hashtags, and finalize the upload on each tab.

## Best Practices

### Avoiding TikTok Blocks

TikTok has sophisticated bot detection that can temporarily block your access. Recommendations:

**Upload in Small Batches**

- 1-3 clips at a time (safest)
- 4-5 clips (moderate risk)

#### If You Get Blocked

If you see this error:

```
Access Denied
You don't have permission to access "http://www.tiktok.com/upload?"
Reference #18.xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxx
```

**Recovery steps:**

- Wait 10-30 minutes (or longer for repeated blocks)
- Clear TikTok cookies
- Try incognito mode
- Switch networks
